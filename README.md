# Pedestrian Detection Using Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model for pedestrian detection. The model is designed to detect pedestrians in images and draw bounding boxes around them. 

## Contents
- Code for loading and preprocessing pedestrian dataset.
- Bounding box visualizations for detected pedestrians.
- Instructions to run the code and evaluate the model.
- Model weights for the trained/fine-tuned model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- PyTorch

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains pedestrian images and bounding box annotations:
